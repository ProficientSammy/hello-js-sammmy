Prototype Development Report
Steps Taken
Initial Setup: Created a basic HTML structure for the quiz interface, including sections for the question display, scoreboard, and answer options.
Styling: Added CSS to center the quiz container, set a specific color scheme for buttons and text, and defined spacing and layout. The goal was a clean, user-friendly look that adapts well to various screen sizes.
JavaScript Functionality: Developed JavaScript functions to fetch questions, manage score tracking, and dynamically display answer choices. Event listeners were set up for form submissions and answer selection, aiming for a smooth user experience.
Resources Used
JavaScript Documentation: MDN Web Docs provided examples and best practices for JavaScript functions, especially around event handling.
CSS Layout Guidance: Resources on Flexbox from CSS Tricks helped with container alignment and responsive design.
Quiz API: Utilized a public quiz API to dynamically load questions based on difficulty level.
Challenges Faced
Responsive Design: Ensuring the layout remained visually appealing on different screen sizes required several CSS adjustments.
Data Fetching: Handling API responses and dynamically generating question and answer elements was complex, especially for the answer selection logic.
Score Persistence: Managing local storage for score tracking took time, as it involved troubleshooting data persistence across sessions.
