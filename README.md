To create the quiz app, I started by setting up the basic structure using HTML and Bootstrap 5.3.1 for styling, which made it easier to design a clean, responsive layout. I used JavaScript to handle the functionality, including fetching questions from the QuizAPI.io API using the Fetch API and dynamically displaying them. Event listeners were added for handling user actions like selecting answers and submitting forms. The hardest part was ensuring correct answer tracking and localStorage integration for score persistence, but breaking it into smaller tasks helped resolve issues. Overall, resources like Bootstrap documentation and MDN Web Docs were invaluable in completing this project.
